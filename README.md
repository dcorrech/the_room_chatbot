# the_room_chatbot
Feasibility study on chatbots in Prolog, using Tommy Wiseau's "The Room" as inspiration.

**What is the problem?**
The aim of our project is to explore whether Prolog is well-suited to building a chatbot application and, furthermore, a natural language processor.

The theme of our chatbot is the movie The Room by Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero. As such, our chatbot will attempt to emulate what it would be like to interact with the most infamous character of The Room: Johnny. This will not be any ordinary chat. It will be an exclusive, one-on-one chat with Johnny where you have unadulterated access to Johnny's transcendent wisdom of life. Think of it like talking to Dr. Phil on Adderall. You will be able to ask Johnny for life advice pertaining to a particular set of topics (which will be decided later). Prepare yourself for the journey of a lifetime.

There are two main tasks for this project: (1) build a natural language processor in Prolog and (2) build the underlying logic of the bot itself (i.e. the knowledge system).

We will use the natural language processor to identify key phrases and words in the user's provided input. These key phrases and words will then be input to the chatbot, which will decide how to respond to the input. The chatbot will then respond to the user with a phrase of its own, and then wait for more input from the user.

**What is the something extra?**
There are a couple of features we could add as extras: (1) add randomization to the chatbot's responses where it makes sense to, (2) enable the chatbot to respond with pictures, videos, or music clips, and (3) enable the chatbot to adapt and learn from the conversation (e.g. the chatbot might learn the user's name or certain responses from the user may lead to the chatbot becoming angry or pleased with the user.
